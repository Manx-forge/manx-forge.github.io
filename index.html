            <h2>Manx</h2>
            <p>
                Manx Gaelic (Gaelg) is a Celtic language spoken on the Isle of Man. Since experiencing a period of decline in recent centuries, the language has benefited from community-led revitalisation efforts and now continues to grow through educational programs, community events, and media.
            </p>
            <p>
                The data published here could not exist without the extensive documentation efforts of community members who have worked to preserve and promote the language in recent years. Their contributions form the foundation upon which this work is built.
