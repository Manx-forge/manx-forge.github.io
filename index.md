**Manx**  
Manx Gaelic (Gaelg) is a Celtic language spoken on the Isle of Man. Since experiencing a period of decline in recent centuries, the language has benefited from community-led revitalisation efforts and now continues to grow through educational programs, community events, and media. The data published here could not exist without the extensive documentation efforts of community members who have worked to preserve and promote the language in recent years. Their contributions form the foundation upon which this work is built.

## What You'll Find Here
- **Speech Transcription Data**: Resources for speech-to-text data (recordings and corresponding transcriptions) in structured format.
- **Translation Data**: Parallel corpora and resources for speech-to-speech, speech-to-text, and text-to-text translation tasks.
- **Text Resources**: Collections of monolingual Manx text and other linguistic data, such as dependency labels and part-of-speech (POS) tags.
- **Audio Resources**: Digitised audio recordings to support speech-based applications.
- **Dictionaries and Lexicons**: Digital dictionaries and lexical resources for language technology development.

In summary, if a Manx language resource exists in a digital format, we aim to collect it and convert it into a more computer-readable format in order to advance Manx language technologies.
